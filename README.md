# LoginKotlinTemplate

This project is a separate module that implements the login process with backend server for a new user, so far the project has only basic concepts:
- User login
- User registration
- User forgot password interaction
- Main screen ( simulate user profile )

In this small module, for the convenience of future constructions, only a minimum was used to provide understanding for any developer. And in future releases, there will be other branches with more complex implementations. At the moment, such dependencies are present:
- Many activities
- ViewBinding
